Project: Speakeasy

Group Member Names: James Cape, Billy Urrutia, David Hardy, Aurie Gochenour

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
1. David: Make it to demo night.
1. Billy: Create a working product and win.
1. James: Make something that people would want to use.


Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
1. David: Same as James, but also need structured delegation of 'divide 'n conquer.' Re-DTR a lot. Make sure people are on the same page with the team before implementing things or building out anything that might change the project.
1. Billy: Likes pairing and working with people, can has no problem splitting up when we can.
1. James: I'd like to start off as a group and eventually break the project into smaller problems we can attack by ourselves. I like asking for help.


How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
1. David: Comfortable with acting as team lead when needed. Also agile when things might change or if someone becomes an expert on a certain portion of the project.
1. Billy: Researching docs and helping others overcome blocks.
1. James: I like using the project board as a central communication tool and am happy to keep it organized and up to date.


Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
1. David: Available most all the time and wants to put lots of effort into this project.
1. Billy: Wants to do remote days for himself on Saturdays but is otherwise mostly available.
1. James: Has obligation Thursday, July 25 at 6:30-~9pm. I want to be available at all other times as much as possible. Has try_coding lunch q&a Saturday and wife airport pick-up at 1pm Sunday (will be here before and after).
 (either text or voice calls).

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
1. David: We need to stay up to date with each other. If anything comes up, check in with the team / send a message through slack to let everyone know at the same time.
1. Billy: Likes in-person communication.
1. James: Everyone keeps the project board up to date so no one else duplicates work that's already being done. If you claim a card, assign your name to it. Aim for one pull from master each day so everyone stays close to the same codebase.


Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
1. David: APIs in general - gain familiarity with consuming.
1. Billy: Wants to learn how to work quickly and overcome obstacles thrown our way.
1. James: Want to learn how different APIs offer different services or information and find out how much we actually have at our fingertips (not just this project, but in general).


Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
1. David: Alexa/Amazon
1. Billy: Slack
1. James: Microservice - hooking up webhooks to CI/Flask, receiving an API and sending and API in Flask.


Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
1. David: Plan the overall project, then split it up into general day-by-day goals. Come together at the end of the day to talk about where we are on each point, what we have planned to do, and we we just did.
1. Billy: Have descriptive commits/branch names. Wants to emphasize meeting endpoints.
1. James: I'd like to merge and pull at least once a day so we don't stray too far on different code. If you make a PR, send a message through Slack so everyone can pull it into theirs.


Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
1. David: Accept that there will be times where discussions are needed for whatever issues might come up. Just be willing to acknowledge that and be willing to have those conversations.
1. Billy: Keep the rubric in mind when a disagreement comes up and try to defer to that.
1. James: I'm happy to be criticized but I appreciate some sort of alternate or a solution to go along with it. What am I doing wrong and also how can I do it better instead?


Project management tools we will use:
1. Pivotal project board, Github, Slack, Github Wiki page


Weekend Agenda:
1. Setup a Buildkite CI server
1. Have webhook trigger an API to Flask
1. Have Flask accept the API, and create/send a new one to the Rails app
1. Attach an Alexa device to the Rails app - then have it send/receive messages to/from Rails
